<p>
Technological capability evolves according to
<equation>
\dot{z} = z^{\phi} R^{\eta}
</equation>
There is a mass $L$ of labor, which grows at rate $n$. A mass $R$ is devoted
to research. Output is simply
<equation>
Y = z(L-R)
</equation>
Define the state variable
<equation>
q = z^{\phi-1}L^{\eta}
</equation>
Let the share of labor devoted to research satisfy $R = s_R L$ so that
<equation>
g = \frac{\dot{z}}{z} = q s_R^{\eta}
</equation>
The state variable $Q$ evolves according to
<equation>
\frac{\dot{q}}{q} = \eta n - (1-\phi) g = \eta n - (1-\phi) q s_R^{\eta}
</equation>
